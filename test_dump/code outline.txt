take input asm 
clean asm from comment and white space 
identify label , instruction , operand 

pass_1 :- error and  warn search 
:- error related to label , might need whole different data structers for this 
:- error related to instruction and operand 
:- warning infinite loop , halt , 
:- storing warning in the output file might also print in console 
pass_2 :- now time to make listing file and machine code file if needed 

//
error considering 
1 :- error's that depend on that code line doesn't need any look up 
	A:- operand nature differecne this means operand cant have space or anything like that  , no matching instruction ,  
0 - fine 
1 - incorrect instruction name 
2 - more than expected operand 
3 - if code type 1 and operand doent have only numeric 
4 - if
